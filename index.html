        1. Describe briefly the term “web-based computing”.
    </p>
    <p>
        Web-based computing is the utilization of the web to provide widespread interconnectivity and communication between users through web browsers that allow
        access to various web applications (such as e-mail, sales, and wikis), protocols (such as HTTP and SMTP), and standards. Web based computing embodies a
        client-server model (with the web browser as the client) and allows for the creation of internal organizational networks referred to as intranets. Cloud
        computing is a form of web based computing.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. What are the differences between client-server computing and peer-to-peer computing?
    </p>
    <p>
        The primary difference between client-server computing and peer-to-peer computing (p2p) is that, in the former, there is a distinguished server(s) that
        store and control access to information and applications from the clients who request such information. The client’s access is limited by the rights given
        to them by the server. Typically, the servers authenticate a client’s access though the utilization of a username and password combination; each unique
        combination has set access levels that are dictated by the system’s network administrator.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a p2p network each system acts as a client and a server simultaneously (since there’s no central server). This means that there’s no access
        authentication and relatively little control between connected systems. Each system in a p2p network shares files equally and can access all shared
        document. The security is relatively lacking in p2p network which allow for an optional network password as the only barrier to access.

            8.5 Which class of instructions can reduce performance by potentially invalidating the instructions in a pipeline? Identify two methods that can be
            used to partially overcome this problem.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        8.4- Pipelining reduces the average number of steps in the execution phase because it allows the execution of multiple instructions simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
        8.5- Branching can potentially invalidate instructions in a pipeline. This is solved using branch prediction; where the target instruction is fetched
        before it’s needed. Additionally, separating the pipelines for both possibilities can partially overcome this problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Ex. 8.16, p. 263.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>8.16 When a system has multiple levels of cache memory, L2 always has more memory than L1. Why is this necessary?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Also briefly explain how cache memory works.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Cache memory is organized into blocks. Each block provides a small amount of storage. Memory requests go to the cache controller which checks the request
        against each tag. If there is a match, the cache location is used instead of memory. If there is no match, the cache controller replaces a line with the
        current memory request. After it’s replaced, the new cache line is treated as before.
    </p>
    <p>
        L2 must have more memory than L1 otherwise they would contain the same information. L2 is larger than L1 which makes it relatively slower; however this is
        necessary because L2 is checked when L1 misses a memory request. The presence of L2 reduces how often memory requests must go to the main memory to be met
        (which reduces processing speed via stalling).

    <p>
        <strong>
            8.17 Modern computers are usually described as multicore. What does this mean? Under Ideal conditions, what performance gain would be achieved using a
            four-core processor over a single-core processor?
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Multi-core means the computers has multiple core processing units. The performance gains for utilizing multiple core processors (over a single core
        processor) include:
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Lower clock speeds
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Reduced power consumption
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Reduced heat
    </p>
    <p>
        4. Reduced stress
    </p>
    <p>
        5. More instructions can be executed simultaneously, increasing computational power
    </p>
    <p>
        6. Programs can be divided into independent pieces that execute simultaneously
    </p>
    <p>
        7. Data dependencies and cache misses are less likely to stall the pipelines in multi-core processors since each core has its own L1 memory cache in
        addition to L2 that is shared between the cores.
    </p>

        <strong>Ex. 8.18, p. 263</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            8.18 Identify and brieﬂy explain two different ways of conﬁguring a multiprocessing system. Which conﬁguration is more effective for general-purpose
            computing? Which conﬁguration is more effective for handling specialized processing tasks, such as those used in game applications?
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Symmetrical multiprocessing (SMP)-</u>
        Each CPU has identical access to the operating system and all system resources. Each CPU schedules its own work utilizing protocols determined by the
        operating system. Each CPU is identical.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Master – Slave Processing-</u>
        One CPU acts as the master to manage the system and control all resources and scheduling. Only the master can execute the operating system. The master CPU
        assigns work to the other CPUs, referred to as Slaves.
    </p>
    <p>
        SMP has more advantages in general-purpose computing. These include:
    </p>
    <p>
        - Every CPU has equal operating system access
    </p>
    <p>
        - Any CPU can process any task and can process any interrupt
    </p>
    <p>
        - Processors are kept equally busy—better workload balance
    </p>
    <p>
        - Easy to implement fault-tolerant computing
    </p>
    <p>
        - Failure of a single CPU will decrease performance, but not cause a system failure
    </p>
    <p>
        Master-Slave Processing is more effective for handling specialized processing tasks because the Master CPU satisfies the need for a master control program,
        while the Slave CPUs provide support through repetitive or continuous, computational and data-intensive, and time-critical tasks.

        1. <strong>Ex. 9.4, p. 293</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Consider the interrupt that occurs at the completion of a disk transfer.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>a. </strong>
        <strong>“Who” is interrupting “whom”?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The I/O module interrupts the CPU to signal that the transfer is complete

    <p>
        <strong> </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>b. </strong>
        <strong>Why is the interrupt used in this case? What would be necessary if there were no interrupt capability on this computer?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The interrupt signals the transfer is complete so the system that initiated the transfer may resume. Without interrupt capabilities, another mechanism
        would be needed to send the completion signals to the CPU and OS or program that initiated the transfer.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>c. Describe the steps that take place after the interrupt occurs.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        After it occurs the interrupt handler in the computer’s memory sends a signal to the program or OS letting it know it may resume.

        <strong>What is an interrupt vector?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What is polling used for? What are the disadvantages of polling? What is a better way to perform the same job?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        An interrupt vector is the address of the interrupting device that is sent with the interrupt signal. When an interrupt vector is not used, polling helps
        the interrupt handler identify the device that requested the interrupt. Polling is slower than interrupt vectors because it requires sending a signal and
        waiting for a reply each time the handler tries to process an interrupt. Masking provides a better way to handle interrupts because it prevents critical
        interrupts from being interrupted in addition to storing the interrupts until a critical task has been completed.

        3. <strong>Ex. 9.14, p. 293</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong> Describe the steps that occur when a system receives multiple interrupts.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        When a system receives multiple interrupts they are prioritized by the system manager. First, when an interrupt is received the original program is
        suspended; second the interrupt service is processed; if that service also becomes interrupted it will be suspended until the last interrupt processes.
        When the processes are complete, the process that was most recently suspended will resume in a first in first out fashion until all interrupts have been
        processed. Finally, control is returned to the original program.

            What are the advantages of ﬂash memory over hard disk storage? What are the advantages of hard disk over ﬂash memory storage? What are the advantages
            of both hard disk and ﬂash memory storage over RAM? What is the major advantage of RAM over other types of storage?
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Flash memory provides swifter access speeds and is more reliable than hard disk storage. This is partially due to the fact that it exists in a solid state,
        as opposed to a spinning disk, which critically reduces the chance of mechanical failure. The solid state also increases data access times since there’s no
        need to wait on a spinning platter to spin to the correct sector for access. This makes flash memory more expensive than hard disk storage. Hard disk
        storage is also available is larger sizes. Both types of memory are ROM so data is saved after the power is removed. RAM is much quicker than flash and, by
        extension, hard disks storage yet is cleared each time the computer loses power.

            Figure 11.8 shows that a typical computer system is interconnected with a number of different buses, both internal and external. The diagram includes
            multiple cache buses, an external CPU bus, PCI-Express buses, a parallel PCI bus, SATA buses, USB ports, and more. What are the advantages of providing
            multiple buses rather than connecting everything together with a single bus?
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Running multiple buses is necessary because each bus has advantages due to specialization in carrying out specific tasks. This allows each bus to perform
        its specialized task in a much swifter fashion and outperform the capabilities of a generalized bus. The overall synergy and speed of a computer is
        improved due to having diverse bus capabilities since each bus can perform specialized tasks in a swift manner.

            Cloud computing is a recent technology being marketed and used as a means to provide off-site computing power to an organization. Locate information
            about cloud computing and compare cloud computing with grid computing. In what ways are they similar? How do they differ?
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Grid computing involves combining the processing power of multiple individual computers to create a larger virtual machine that utilizes the combined
        processing power to provide supercomputer like processing. Cloud computing, on the other hand, involves having one large and powerful system provide
        computing power to a wide variety of smaller systems on an as needed (or as paid for) basis. Essentially, Grid computing utilizes the combined power of
        multiple individual machines to provide performance equal to the sum of borrowed resources (minus the resources needed to correlate the processing between
        machines) while cloud computing uses one powerful machine to power multiple smaller machines. The cloud computing can also be performed through utilizing
        grid computing to combine the processing power of multiple powerful systems to create an even more powerful system that can in-turn provide computing power
        to numerous smaller machines.

        <strong>Problem 5 </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        A signal travels from point A to B in a communication channel. The signal power at points A and B are 10000 and 100 Watts, respectively. Calculate the
        signal gain/loss in [decibels – dB] at point B. Was the signal attenuated or amplified?
    </p>
    <p>
        Loss [dB] = 10log10(100/10000) = 10 * log10(0.01) = 10 * -2 = -20 dB
    </p>
    <p>
        The signal was attenuated.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Problem 6 </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        A signal travels from point A to B in a communication channel. The signal power at points A and B are 100 and 10000 Watts, respectively. Calculate the
        signal gain/loss in [decibels – dB] at point B. Was the signal attenuated or amplified?
    </p>
    <p>
        Gain [dB] = 10log10(10000/100) = 10 * log10(100) = 10 * 2 = 20 dB
    </p>
    <p>
        The signal was amplified.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Problem 7 </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You should know from the slides on chapter 14 covered in the classroom that the speed of data transmission over a communication channel depends on the
        bandwidth of the channel [expressed in Hz] as well as the power of the signal and noise of the channel [both expressed in Watts]. Shannon proposed a
        formula that allows one to calculate the maximum data rate [expressed in bps (bits/second)] for an analog signal with noise send over a channel.
    </p>
    <p>
        S = f × log2 (1+W/N)
    </p>
    <p>
        where:
    </p>
    <p>
        - S – data transfer rate in bps
    </p>
    <p>
        - f – signal bandwidth [expressed in Hz]
    </p>
    <p>
        - W – signal power [in Watts], and
    </p>
    <p>
        - N – noise power [in Watts]
    </p>
    <p>
        Calculate the data rate (speed of transmission) of the telephone signal of 4 KHz bandwidth, 0.2 Watts of
    </p>
    <p>
        power, and 0.002 Watts of noise? (Note that the log function uses base 2.)
    </p>
    <p>
        S = 4000Hz * log2(1+0.2W/0.002W) = 4000Hz * log2(101)= 4000Hz * 6.6582114828 = 26632.846 bps
